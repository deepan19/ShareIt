A MERN full stack social media web application that uses redux
In this project, I explored how to fully build a MERN stack web application.
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.JS.
Along with the above technologies, i also used redux to enable my application to scale well in the future, if i decide to add additional functionality.
